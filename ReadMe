In a health emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to have a clear view of the spread of the virus in Tunisia, so we have created the Power BI report to highlight the impact of COVID - 19, confirmed cases, number of death and recovered cases. 

We have some reports related to cases over time, daily cases, cases by governorate and more.

It is in french.
